-IoT AI generative Device developed using Flask,MongoDB via Python
- Communication between several Raspberry Pi's
-Utilises AWS tools such as Lambda,IoT Core,Bedrock,S3,DynamoDB,SNS,SES,IAM,EC2,Cognito and API Gateway

-This application is a carbon footprint application that utilises AI processig to provide users advice and guidance through the measuring sensor data.Additionally notifying users and guiding them to mangage their carbon footprint percentage using AI predictive analysis
